## Project Structure

This is a **monorepo** that uses Git submodules for each service:

```
evo-crm-community/
├── evo-auth-service-community/    # Authentication service (submodule)
├── evo-ai-crm-community/         # CRM backend service (submodule)
├── evo-ai-frontend-community/    # Frontend application (submodule)
├── evo-ai-processor-community/   # Message processor (submodule)
├── evo-ai-core-service-community/# Core service (submodule)
├── docker-compose.yml            # Local development orchestration
├── Makefile                      # Development commands
└── setup.sh                      # One-command setup script
```

Each submodule is an independent repository. Changes to a specific service should be submitted to that service's repository. The monorepo handles orchestration, CI/CD, and shared documentation.

## Style Guidelines

Each service may have its own coding standards and linters. Defer to the conventions established in the service you're modifying. When in doubt, follow the patterns you see in existing code.
